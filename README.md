# Blender for Android

**An unofficial fork of Blender, ported to Android. arm64, Vulkan, built and
tested on a Galaxy S24 Ultra.**

## A study project

This started as a way to learn, and that is what it stayed. It is not
maintained, and there is no active support behind it: an open source project
deserves time that I do not have right now, and saying so plainly beats leaving
people waiting for an answer that is not coming.

It is public because it works, and because some of what is in here might be
useful to someone. The on-screen keyboard, for example, is a native one drawn by
Blender itself that sends real key events, so it types into any field, holds
Ctrl, Shift and Alt, and fires every shortcut in the keymap. If any of this is
worth something to the Blender developers, or to anyone porting Blender to a
touch device, take it.

Anyone who wants it for study is welcome to download it, build it and
contribute. Nothing here is waiting on permission.

One warning: this tree does not follow Blender's own structure everywhere. It
carries a lot of experiments, and some of them left marks. Read it as a
sketchbook, not as a reference implementation.

## Credits

This port did not start with me. It started with [**@idimus**](https://www.reddit.com/user/idimus/)
(a.k.a. simfeo), who did the hard bring up work, and whose release is
the build this fork was derived from:

- <https://github.com/simfeo/blender/releases/tag/android-alpha-1>
- @idimus / simfeo's releases: <https://github.com/simfeo/blender/releases>

And of course **Blender** itself, made and maintained by the Blender Foundation
and its community. None of this exists without them.

The adjustments in this fork are by **Wanderson M. Pimenta**.

## About the code

I am new to C++. I wrote my first line of code 19 years ago, but this port was
my first real experience with the language, against a codebase far larger than
me. **ChatGPT Sol** and **Claude Opus 5** are what made it possible: they carried
the cross compilation of dependency after dependency and a great deal of the
debugging. Without them I would not have had the time to even run these
experiments, let alone finish them.

## Building and installing

Everything you need is in **[ANDROID\_AI\_GUIDE.md](ANDROID_AI_GUIDE.md)**:
prerequisites, the dependency build, the two feature sets, the flags that
matter, the traps that end in a build that looks fine while the device runs old
code, how to drive a device over ADB, and a map of every change with a link to
the file it lives in.

## License

Blender is licensed under the GNU General Public License, Version 3, and this
fork inherits it. If you distribute a binary built from this tree, the matching
source has to go with it.
